# 2022AntarcticHeatwave_attribution_storylines
This is the Jupyter notebooks required to reproduce the research plots of March 2022 Antarctic Heatwave storyline study with CRYOWRF.

This repository is divided in different notebooks that:
  - 00a. Compares Observations and CRYOWRF outputs
  - 00b. Show the CMIP6 deltas in Antarctica
  - 01a. Plot the temperature storylines of the event for formal attribution and future storylines
  - 02a. Plot the physical amplification drivers for the current simulation with respect to the preindustrial simulation
  - 02b. Plot the physical amplification drivers for the future simulations with respect to the current simulation
  - 03a. Plot the heatwave processes for the current simulation with respect to the preindustrial simulation
  - 03b. Plot the heatwave processes for the future simulations with respect to the current simulation
  - 04a. Plot the SMB changes for the current simulation with respect to the preindustrial simulation
  - 05a. Calculate the mean density in the first 0.5 m of the snowpack
  - 05b. Plot the temperature and density changes on the snowpack of Concordia
  - 05c. Plot the firn changes (firn air content, liquid water content and ice lens thickness)
  - 06a. Plot the evolution of the event in the control (current) simulation
